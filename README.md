# Bamazon #

Bamazon is an Amazon-like CLI app which allows customers to view inventory and place orders.

The customer interface allows the user to view the current inventory of store items.  The user is then able to purchase one of the existing items by entering the item ID and the desired quantity. Interfacing with mySQL the item's stock quantity is able to be updated in the database with each purchase. If the selected quantity is currently in stock, the user's order is fulfilled, displaying the total purchase price. If the desired quantity is not available, the user is alerted the item currently does not hold enough stock.
